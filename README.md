# Javascript-Challenge
## The purpose of this project is to build a HTML webpage which contains a table with six columns of data that can be filtered based on the date colum with the use of JavaScript to build the table, filter the data, and re-build the table based on the input box and button click.

# The Process
## An arrary of JavaScript objects containing data about UFO sightings are used to create the table inside the HTML.
## A JavaScipt filter is utilized to filter the data based on the value of the input form === to date.  
## Event listeners are then utilized to filter the data based on date the moment a user click on the "Filter Table" button.

# Testing the App
## The index HTML file and static sub-folder are located in the UFO_Level_1 folder.  The static sub-folder contains a folder named js which contains the JavaScript file and the data for this project.  The index file can be loaded straight into the Chrome browser or can be examined in a program such as Visual Studio Code.  The JavaScript file and data can also be viewed in Visual Studio Code.  Once the index file is running on a browser, the user can enter a data and filter the data based on the date once the "Filter Table" button is clicked. Once the input box is cleared, the user can click the "Filter Table" button again to view the unfiltered data.
